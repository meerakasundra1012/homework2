Structuring Strategy - from structure.html


Document Outline
I looked at structure.html and wrote out the outline like this:

body
  header (role="banner") - has the h1 Comp 484 and h2 for page title, plus the nav
  main (role="main")
    article - the main content
      header - intro with h3 and paragraph
      section - each major topic (Sectioning elements, Document outlines, etc.)
      aside (role="complementary") - the W3C warning box
  footer (role="contentinfo") - CSUN address

How the structural tags are used
- aside = for extra/side content like the W3C warning, with role="complementary"
- article = wraps the whole main content of the page
- nav = the navigation links at the top, role="navigation"
- section = each part of the article that has its own h3 heading

Semantic tags (header, footer, main)
- header = used at the top of the page (h1, h2, nav) and also inside article for the intro
- footer = at the bottom with the CSUN info, role="contentinfo"
- main = wraps the primary content so there's one main area per page, role="main"

ARIA roles I used
- header -> role="banner"
- nav -> role="navigation"
- main -> role="main"
- aside -> role="complementary"
- footer -> role="contentinfo"

Diagram (task 1d)
I made a diagram of the tag structure - see images/document-structure-diagram.png. It shows body with header, main (article + sections), and footer.

Document outline screenshot (task 1d)
To get the document outline I used the website from the slides (or you can use validator.nu or a HeadingsMap extension). Then take a screenshot and put it in the images folder.
